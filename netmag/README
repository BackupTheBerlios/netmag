About
-----
Currently the program is very similar to the Windows magnifier. It tracks the
cursor and displays the region around the cursor in it's windows. While the
Windows magnifier only zooms in integrals >= 1 (1:1, 1:2, 1:4, ...), netmag
allows for more zoom factors and for shrinking, too (1:3.24, 1.5:1, 2:1, ...).
To do so successfully, netmag supports anti aliasing. However, staying in
integral factors speeds up zooming.

There are two applications at the moment:

1. Play around with it. As it copies it's own window, funny graphics effects
are attained.

2. Hop to graphics preferences and extend your desktop to 2 monitors, even if
you only have one. The content of the second monitor can be viewed in netmag's
window.


Compilation
-----------
At the moment, netmag uses cygwin1.dll, only to be able to compile with gcc. The
makefile will probably not work out of the box, unless you use DevC++ in it's
default path, but as it's only one big file, it shouldn't be a problem to adopt
it to other compilers.

Usage
-----
Just call the program. Clicking (X) or pressing ESC or Q quits the program, H
will call the help screen (I'll implement that today).

Known Issues
------------
Currently only works with the desktop set to 32bit color depth.
