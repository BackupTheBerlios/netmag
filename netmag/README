About
-----
Currently the program is very similar to the Windows magnifier. It tracks the
cursor and displays the region around the cursor in it's windows.

There are two applications at the moment:

1. Play around with it. As it copies it's own window, funny graphics effects
are attained.

2. Hop to graphics preferences and extend your desktop to 2 monitors, even if
you only have one. The content of the second monitor can be viewed in netmag's
window.


Compilation
-----------
Please edit the Makefile as netmag uses mingw's includes and libs included in
devcpp, even if I don't use devcpp (I prefer vim).

You'll need either mingw or devcpp or cygwin. After porting to nmake and msvc,
it should work easily with Microsofts Visual C++.

Usage
-----
Just call the program. Clicking (X) or pressing ESC quits the program.

Known Issues
------------
Currently only works with the desktop set to 32bit color depth.
